Welcome to AllfredOne's World !

A world identical to our own for many aspects, except for the fact that some individuals have strange and astonishing powersâ€¦ completely wasted on them.

AllfredOne is the perfect example. A fat, lazy, sleepy inept who (for some reason) was gifted with a power that makes him even more lazy, if possible.

He was born with a strange power, he can spawn clones of himself, so he can do nothing all his life, always delegating all the job to his clones.

Our story starts when AllfredOne move in a new house, and as usual his clones must do all the work...
